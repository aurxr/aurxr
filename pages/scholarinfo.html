		<h1>Carroll College's Fighting Saints ROTC Program</h1>
		<h2>Scholarship Information</h2>
		<p><span class="highlight">KEEP IN MIND:</span> ROTC scholarships are highly competitive and are not guaranteed.
			Students
			interested in pursuing a scholarship must meet specific requirements, including passing the Army Combat
			Fitness
			Test (ACFT) at least once per semester and maintaining satisfactory academic performance throughout their
			studies.
			Once these prerequisites are fulfilled, cadets may be eligible for two-year, three-year, or four-year
			scholarships. These scholarships can cover 100% of tuition, and often include a $200 book stipend per
			semester,
			housing support, and a monthly stipend of $200â€”unless otherwise specified. Scholarships are awarded based on
			merit, leadership potential, and overall performance both in the classroom and in ROTC training.</p>
		<p>Students who receive financial assistance through the ROTC program are required to contract with the a
			service
			branch of their choice. While the specifics of contracting are tailored to each individual, and therefore
			not
			fully disclosed upfront, cadets should understand that a commitment to serve is required. Those who contract
			are
			expected to serve on active duty for approximately four to six years in the branch they select at the time
			of
			contracting.</p>
		<p>National Guard and Army Reserve options also exist for students who wish to pursue a part-time service
			commitment
			while receiving financial support. These programs often include monthly drill pay, annual training pay, and
			additional educational benefits such as the Montgomery GI Bill and Federal Tuition Assistance. This route
			may be
			ideal for students who want to balance civilian careers or graduate education with their military service.
