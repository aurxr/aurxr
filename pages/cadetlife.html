        <h2>Life of a Cadet</h2>
        <p>Cadets, both contracted and non, are expected to be at the H.A.C., Hunthausen Activity Center, no later than 5:50am to conduct physical training -- typically refered to as PT. On Fridays, cadets will go to the weightlifting room while Wednesday are rest days. Once in the designated area, cadets being PRT, physical readiness training at 6am until about 6:10am. After PRT, the work begins. A typical morning can include a distance run, circuits, hill sprints up Gaud hill, ACFT related drills, teamwork based physical games, or stair runs up Saint Charles steps. After PT, many cadets head to the dining hall to enjoy breakfast before heading to classes. </p>
        <p>At the start of the year, all cadets are required to attend office hours until sufficent grades have been provided to prove the hours are no longer necessary. The average ask of office hours is about 4 hours completed at the persons disgression. Beyond that, most weekdays for freshman and sophomores don't consist of many ROTC related activies on weekdays unless an event, training, or practice has been scheduled. Juniors and seniors, however, are typically delegated tasks that involve organizing Friday labs or any other upcoming training event. Furthermore, seniors are trusted to hold office hours for underclassman to help with either ROTC related questions or schoolwork help. </p>
        <p>On Fridays from 1pm to 5pm, all those participating in ROTC must attend lab unless excused by cadre. Labs can sometimes be indoors when a class is being taught; however, they are typically condcuted outside. Once accountability is taken, every one participating in lab will adhere to the transportation plan then head up to Sweeney Creek. While at Sweeney Creek, cadets will do tactical training by praciting movements like ambush, raid, defense, or move to contact. BE PREPARED: lab can be phsyically draining due to all the strenuous, tactical, and fast past movement!</p>
        <p>FTX and Commissioning events attendance is required! </p>
