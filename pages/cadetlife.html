			<h2>Life of a Cadet</h2>
			<p>Cadets—both contracted and non-contracted—are expected to arrive at the Hunthausen Activity Center no later
				than 5:50 a.m. for physical training. On Fridays, cadets train in the weightlifting room, while Wednesdays are
				designated rest days. A typical morning may include a distance run, circuit training, hill sprints up Gaud Hill,
				ACFT-related drills, teamwork-based physical games, or stair runs up the Saint Charles steps. After PT, many
				cadets head to the dining hall to enjoy breakfast together before starting their classes.</p>
			<p>Most weekdays for freshmen and sophomores do not involve many ROTC-related activities unless an event,
				training, or practice has been scheduled. Juniors and seniors, however, are usually assigned responsibilities
				such as organizing Friday labs or coordinating upcoming training events. In addition, seniors are entrusted with
				holding office hours to assist underclassmen with ROTC-related questions or academic support.</p>
			<p>On Fridays from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., all cadets participating in ROTC are required to attend lab unless
				excused by cadre. Labs may occasionally be held indoors for instructional purposes, but are typically conducted
				outside. After accountability is taken, all cadets follow the designated transportation plan and travel to
				Sweeney Creek. While there, cadets engage in tactical training exercises such as ambush, raid, defense, and
				movement to contact. <strong>BE PREPARED:</strong> Lab can be physically demanding due to the strenuous,
				tactical, and fast-paced movements!</p>
