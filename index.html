      <h2>An Overview of Carroll's Program</h2>
      <p>Carroll's ROTC program is committed to shaping the next generation of exceptional leaders. Through a combination of military science courses and physical fitness training, we prepare students to lead with confidence, purpose, and integrity. Our approach to leadership development is rooted in our three defining mottos that guide our program: teamwork is key, pay attention to details, and legs feed the wolf.</p>
      <p>Students who complete all required military science courses and fulfill the program's academic and physical standards will earn a minor in Leadership in addition to their chosen major. As ROTC is an elective program, it can be paired with any degree path, offering students both flexibity and new opprotunities.</p>
      <p>Upon graduation, participants are commissioned as officers in the United States Army, where they can utilize the specializations acquired from Carroll's program. More than just an elective, the Carroll ROTC program proudly builds leaders who are ready to meet the demands of tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Carroll's program is devoted to transforming people as individuals but building an inseperable team.</p>
